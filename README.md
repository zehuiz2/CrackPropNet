# CrackPropNet

## Introduction

CrackPropNet is an optical flow-based deep neural network for crack propagation measurement in asphalt concrete cracking tests such as semi-circular bending (SCB) test and indirect tension asphalt cracking test (IDEAL-CT). Simply paint your specimen surface with a random black pattern on top of a thin layer of white paint ([tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/)); record a video of the specimen surface during testing ([tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/)). Crack propagation can be accurately and efficiently retrived.
